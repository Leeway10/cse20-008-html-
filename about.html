                <h1>THIS IS EDINBURGH </h1>
                <p>Edinburgh is Scotland's compact, hilly capital. It has a medieval Old Town and elegant Georgian New Town with gardens and neoclassical buildings. Looming over the city is Edinburgh Castle, home to Scotland’s crown jewels and the Stone of Destiny, used in the coronation of Scottish rulers. Arthur’s Seat is an imposing peak in Holyrood Park with sweeping views, and Calton Hill is topped with monuments and memorials.</p>

                <h1>HISTORY OF EDINBURGH</h1>
                <P>
                    For the first settlers of Scotland, arriving at the onset of the postglacial period (as early as 7000 BC), the best access to the interior was provided by estuaries and rivers, with the Forth being among the most important. Its shoreline and mudflats show evidence of Stone Age explorers, who did not yet need the protection of the region’s steep hills. Finds of swords and other metal objects suggest, however, that by about 1500 BC these peoples were using the crags of Arthur’s Seat (also known as the Lion’s Head), the area’s highest hill, for defense. In the Iron Age, which in Scotland began about 700 BC, hill forts proliferated in the Lothians—the area in the immediate vicinity of Edinburgh—and the Borders, to the south. Excavations beginning in the late 1980s within Edinburgh Castle have proved what was long suspected—that the Castle Rock has been occupied since about 1000 BC. Holyrood Park, Blackford Hill, and Craiglockhart Hill all show signs of occupation in the late 1st millennium BC.

Strategic importance
The Romans saw strategic rather than defensive value in the Edinburgh plain between the Pentland Hills and the Forth. During three or four decades in the second half of the 2nd century AD, the Antonine Wall, stretching across Scotland between the River Clyde and the Firth of Forth, was the northernmost defense in Roman Britain, and the site of Cramond (a major Roman garrison), a village on the Forth within the modern city boundary, was the point at which one of Roman Britain’s major north-south roads terminated. (The find in the late 1990s of a sculpture of a lioness, dating from the 2nd or 3rd century AD, in the River Almond in Cramond underscores the importance of the site for the Romans.) The road, with major forts at Dalkeith and Inveresk on the southeastern approaches to the present city, cut through what is now the Meadows district of Edinburgh and guarded access to the Carse of Stirling (valley of the River Forth) and the approach to the west and north.

The Votadini, the dominant Celtic tribe of the Lothians, with whom Rome had a relatively stable relationship, were the group most likely to have occupied the Castle Rock site. The Votadini capital was on Traprain Law, a cone-shaped hill (law) some 20 miles (30 km) east of the modern city, but it appears that about AD 500, after the Roman withdrawal from Britain, the capital was moved to the site of the present castle. A Welsh poem composed about AD 600 describes how a band of the Gododdin (as the Votadini were known in Welsh), from around a place called Din Eidyn, attacked an Anglian force at Catterick in Yorkshire and was annihilated. Din Eidyn—“Eidyn’s Hill Fort”—is clearly the Castle Rock site. In the following centuries Anglian invaders seem to have vanquished the Gododdin, and by AD 854 Din Eidyn (spelled Dun Eideann in Gaelic) had become Edwinesburh, burh meaning “fortress” or “fortified town.” This name later gave rise to the supposition that a Northumbrian princeling called Edwin had founded the town. The date of the poem, however, proves that the name predates Edinburgh’s occupation by the Anglians of Northumbria. Although the Castle Rock site has been continuously occupied for at least 3,000 years, little is known of the town itself before the 11th or 12th century.

The medieval city
Mercantile growth
In the early 12th century, St. Margaret’s Chapel on the Castle Rock and the gate at the Netherbow to Holyrood Abbey, endowed by Margaret’s son King David I, marked the limits of the Old Town, with the parish church of St. Giles between. Sometime in or (more likely) before 1127, David I granted Edinburgh the status of a king’s, or royal, burgh, a privilege that promoted trade by allowing Edinburgh to act both as a market and as a centre for organized manufacture (particularly of cloth). When David instituted the earliest Scottish coinage, one of the king’s mints was situated in Edinburgh. He also granted the monks (canons) of Holyrood their own burgh with their own jurisdiction, which came to be known as the Canongate. The High Street of Edinburgh ended and the Canongate began at the intersection called Netherbow, where Edinburgh’s main town gate (port) was sited.

Political importance
In 1329 King Robert I (Robert the Bruce; reigned 1306–29) granted Edinburgh a charter confirming its privileges as a royal burgh. The city profited from the sack and loss of Berwick (until that time Scotland’s major port) in the Wars of Independence (1296–1328) fought with England. James II (reigned 1437–60) was crowned in Holyrood, and most of his parliaments were held in the burgh (on the site, adjacent to St. Giles, where the Tolbooth was erected in 1466). After the Wars of Independence, Edinburgh quickly developed into Scotland’s major trading centre and was, by the reign of James III (1460–88), its capital; indeed, a royal charter during his reign described Edinburgh as “the principal burgh of our country.”

The medieval burgh—churches and royal and civic buildings apart—was built of wood, and only the houses of the well-to-do had glazed windows and wooden doors. All domestic refuse and the offal of the skinners, butchers, and fishmongers were heaped on either side of the main street, forcing pedestrians to the centre of the thoroughfare. More than a dozen separate markets stretched along the length of the High Street in 1477. The graveyards—including that of St. Giles, in the town centre—were used as rubbish dumps. That Edinburgh was uncommonly nasty in this respect resulted largely from its physical setting and the absence of a convenient water supply. Until 1681 water had to be fetched from pumped wells in the Canongate. William Dunbar, the great Middle Scots poet of the 15th–16th century, wrote in trenchant verse:

May nane pass through your principal gates
for stink of haddocks and of skates,
for cries of carlings [old women] and debates [arguments]…
tailors, souters [shoemakers], and craftis vile
the fairest of your streets does fyle [defile]…
To the moderate prosperity of the late medieval burgh, King James IV (reigned 1488–1513) added a touch of European Renaissance culture. He patronized the arts of both culture and war and about 1501 began the construction of a palace beside Holyrood Abbey, which was substantially added to by his son James V (reigned 1513–42). In 1507, in the Cowgate, a royal license prompted the establishment of Scotland’s first printing press. In the years of political unrest following the disastrous defeat of the Scots by the English at the Battle of Flodden in Northumberland (1513), Edinburgh encircled the Old Town (as far as the Netherbow) with a defensive wall, parts of which still stand (especially in the Pleasance). It proved sadly ineffective, however, as was shown in 1544 when an English commander, the earl of Hertford, devastated part of the town, including the Canongate and Leith.

Although much of the subsequent rebuilding was still of wood, it was from this period and after that stone became more common, both for public buildings and for the residences of the wealthy. Edinburgh’s position made it the seat of not only the court but also the Privy Council, Parliament, and the law. James V established the Court of Session, the central civil-law court, in the capital in 1532. The great landed families began to keep town houses in the Canongate.

From 1500 to 1640 Edinburgh’s population surged, stimulated by an increasing monopoly that it enjoyed over foreign trade and its status as the capital of a growing royal bureaucracy. In 1579 the young King James VI (James I of England from 1603) established a court in near-permanent residence at Holyrood. This urban court opened up Edinburgh to both European culture and aristocratic violence; a number of feuds, murders, and even gunfights between rival gangs of nobles and their retainers took place in the town’s narrow closes. Learning was not forgotten, however. In 1582 James granted the town council a charter encouraging the provision of buildings to house the teaching of “humanity, philosophy, theology, medicine, and laws, or of any other liberal sciences whatsoever.” This stimulated the opening the following year of “the Town’s [Toun’s] College,” which later became the University of Edinburgh.

Political eclipse and continued growth
After 1603, when James VI succeeded to the English throne and left for the south, Edinburgh suffered a decline in political and cultural importance, yet the town continued to grow (from the turn of the 16th century to the end of the 17th century, the population more than quadrupled to some 50,000 people). The first Edinburgh girls’ school, the Merchant Maiden Hospital, was opened in 1605, and construction of Heriot’s Hospital (now George Heriot’s School), a school endowed by the bequest of the goldsmith, moneylender, and philanthropist George Heriot, began in 1628. Parliament House, on the site of St. Giles’s burial ground, was completed in 1639 and was occupied by the Scottish Parliament until its abolition in 1707.

By the mid-17th century the area around St. Giles had become the centre of the capital’s bustling life. Immediately to the west of the church stood the Tolbooth, combining the roles of council chamber, jail, and place of execution. To the south was the Parliament House and embryonic Parliament Close, with the Court of Exchequer. To the north was the narrow tenement called the Luckenbooths, with its street-level shops. Around the church walls were the krames—wooden booths of goldsmiths, jewelers, stationers, and craftsmen. To the east was the Mercat Cross, where business was done from morning to evening.
